## User Stories

- User Story #1: 

> In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.

- User Story #10: 

> When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.

- User Story #11: 

> When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.

- User Story #12: 

> I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.

- User Story #13: 

> If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 x (-5)).

- User Story #14: 

> Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.

- User Story #15: 

> My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
