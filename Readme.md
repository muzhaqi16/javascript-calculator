## User Stories

### User Story #1: 

> In any order, I should be able to `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide` a chain of numbers of `any length`, and when I hit `=`, the correct result should be shown.

### User Story #2: 

> When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to `begin` with `multiple zeros`.

### User Story #3: 

> When the `decimal` element is clicked, a `.` should append to the currently displayed value; `two` `.` in one number should not be accepted.

### User Story #4: 

> I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing `decimal points`.

### User Story #5: 

> If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if `5 + * 7 =` is entered, the result should be `35` (i.e. 5 * 7); if `5 * - 5 =` is entered, the result should be `-25` (i.e. 5 x (-5)).

### User Story #6: 

> Pressing an operator immediately following `=` should start a `new calculation` that operates on the result of the `previous` evaluation.

### User Story #7: 

> My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like `2 / 7` with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
